These techniques automatically select relevant features during the training phase, optimizing both the model's performance and the subset of features used. Here are some common techniques used in embedded feature selection methods:\n",

        "LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator):\n",
        "\n",
        "Description: LASSO is a linear regression technique that adds a penalty term to the ordinary least squares objective function, promoting sparsity in the coefficient estimates. This encourages some coefficients to become exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection.\n",
        "Use Case: Particularly useful when dealing with high-dimensional datasets where many features may be irrelevant or redundant.\n",
        "Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization):\n",
        "\n",
        "Description: Ridge regression is a linear regression technique that adds a penalty term based on the squared magnitudes of the coefficients to the objective function. While it doesn't lead to sparsity in coefficient estimates like LASSO, it can still help control overfitting and indirectly impact feature selection.\n",
        "Use Case: Suitable for scenarios where all features are potentially relevant, but regularization is needed to prevent overfitting.\n",
        "Elastic Net:\n",
        "\n",
        "Description: Elastic Net combines L1 (LASSO) and L2 (ridge) regularization terms in the objective function. It aims to strike a balance between feature sparsity (L1) and handling correlated features (L2).\n",
        "Use Case: Beneficial when there are groups of correlated features, and a mix of sparsity and regularization is desired.\n",
        "Decision Trees and Random Forests:\n",
        "\n",
        "Description: Decision trees inherently perform feature selection by selecting the most informative features at each split. Random Forests, an ensemble of decision trees, extends this by aggregating feature importances across multiple trees.\n",
        "Use Case: Useful when you want to exploit non-linear relationships between features and the target variable.\n",
        "Gradient Boosting Machines:\n",
        "\n",
        "Description: Algorithms like Gradient Boosted Trees (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM) build trees sequentially, and at each step, they focus on the mistakes made by the previous trees. This naturally leads to feature importance, and feature selection is implicit.\n",
        "Use Case: Effective for boosting the predictive performance of models while automatically emphasizing important features.\n",
        "Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) in Support Vector Machines (SVM):\n",

        "Description: RFE is a technique where the model is trained iteratively, and at each iteration, the least important features are removed. SVMs are often used in this process.\n",

        "Description: Neural networks can incorporate regularization techniques, such as dropout or weight decay, which can lead to sparsity in the network's weights, effectively performing feature selection.\n",

        "Drawback: The filter method is independent of the specific learning algorithm used for the final prediction task. While this is an advantage in terms of simplicity and speed, it may not capture complex relationships that are specific to the learning algorithm.\n",
        "Ignores Feature Dependencies:\n",

        "Drawback: Filter methods evaluate features individually and may not consider dependencies or interactions between features. This limitation can lead to overlooking important feature combinations that collectively contribute to predictive performance.\n",
        "Limited to Univariate Statistics:\n",
        "\n",
        "Drawback: Many filter methods rely on univariate statistics (e.g., correlation, mutual information, chi-squared statistics) to score features. Univariate measures may not capture the joint effects of multiple features, potentially missing relevant information.\n",

        "Ignores Model Performance:\n",

        "Drawback: The filter method does not consider the performance of the final model during the feature selection process. Features are selected based on intrinsic properties without regard to how well they contribute to the model's predictive performance.\n",
        "May Select Redundant Features:\n",
