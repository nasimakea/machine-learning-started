        "A decision tree classifier is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It works by recursively partitioning the input data into subsets based on the values of different features, ultimately leading to the assignment of a class label to each data point.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's a general overview of how the decision tree classifier algorithm works:\n",
        "\n",
        "Initialization:\n",
        "\n",
        "The algorithm begins with the entire dataset as the root node of the tree.\n",
        "Feature Selection:\n",
        "\n",
        "It evaluates different features to find the one that best splits the data into homogeneous subsets. This process aims to increase the purity or homogeneity of the subsets, typically using metrics like Gini impurity, entropy, or mean squared error.\n",
        "Splitting:\n",
        "\n",
        "Once the best feature is selected, the dataset is split into subsets based on the chosen feature's values. This creates child nodes connected to the parent node by branches, representing the feature's possible values.\n",
        "Recursive Process:\n",
        "\n",
        "The algorithm repeats the process recursively for each subset created in the previous step. At each level, it selects the best feature to split the data and continues the partitioning until a stopping criterion is met. This criterion could be a maximum tree depth, a minimum number of samples per leaf, or other measures to avoid overfitting.\n",
        "Leaf Nodes and Labels:\n",
        "\n",
        "As the tree grows, certain nodes become leaf nodes, meaning they no longer split further. Each leaf node represents a class label in the case of classification or a predicted value in the case of regression.\n",
        "Prediction:\n",
        "\n",
        "To make predictions for new data, the algorithm traverses the decision tree from the root to a leaf node based on the values of the features in the input data. The class label associated with the reached leaf node is assigned as the predicted output.\n",
        "Decision trees are advantageous due to their interpretability, simplicity, and ability to handle both numerical and categorical data. However, they are susceptible to overfitting, especially when the tree becomes too deep. Techniques like pruning and using ensemble methods, such as Random Forests, can be employed to mitigate these issues and enhance the model's performance."
